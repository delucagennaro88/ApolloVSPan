# ApolloVSPan
This is a simple Counter App, created for the Google Android Basics Scholarship 2017.

I have imagined to create an app that counts the points in a competition (such as a soccer match). 
In my case, the App is dedicated to the legendary musical duel between the god Apollo e the satyr Pan. You can pretend to be the king Midas, the actual judge of that competition, and give points to the competitors' performances (considering intensity, melody, harmony and rhythm).
The pictures of Apollo and Pan are from Europeana database. They are taken from the Miniature of Midas judging the contest between Pan and Apollo (from BL Harley 4431, f. 108 | Christine de Pizan). Here is the link to the image (free of license): http://bit.ly/2CtkWIy
